GenAI Intelligence Platform
Transform the firehose of GenAI news, tools, and research into actionable, context-aware intelligence for your product and engineering teams. This platform automates the discovery, analysis, and evaluation of new AI tools, separating high-signal opportunities from marketing hype.

The Problem
The GenAI space is exploding with new models, libraries, and platforms daily. Staying on top of this innovation is a full-time job. Product managers and engineering leads face significant challenges:

Information Overload: Drowning in news from RSS feeds, social media, and tech blogs.

Hype vs. Reality: Difficulty distinguishing between genuine breakthroughs and marketing fluff.

Relevance Gap: A tool might be powerful, but is it useful for our specific workflows?

Wasted Effort: Teams spend hours evaluating tools that are a poor fit, immature, or have a low ROI.

The Solution
This platform provides a systematic, automated pipeline to ingest, score, and evaluate GenAI tools in the context of your team's specific needs.

Key Features
Automated Ingestion: Continuously scans dozens of RSS feeds (TechCrunch, Product Hunt, GitHub Trending, Reddit, ArXiv) to discover new tools and announcements.

Intelligent Classification: Uses an AI-powered classifier (with a robust heuristic fallback) to categorize content (Tool, Announcement, Research), extract primary capabilities, and assess technical depth.

Common-Sense Tool Gate: A powerful pre-filter that uses rules and semantic embeddings to discard irrelevant content like games or articles, ensuring only adoptable tools are scored.

Multi-Stage Scoring Pipeline: Each tool is passed through a sophisticated scoring engine that evaluates:

Signal Strength: Classifies tools as GAME_CHANGING, HIGH, PROMISING, MODERATE, or NOISE.

Marketing Fluff: Detects and penalizes vague, unverifiable marketing claims.

ROI Analysis: Calculates an estimated payback period, implementation cost, and monthly benefit.

Evidence & Maturity: Scores the tool based on real-world evidence like GitHub stars, production deployments, and documentation.

Contextual Workflow Analysis: Moves beyond generic scores by using an AI Usefulness Overlay to evaluate a tool's specific utility for a defined workflow (e.g., "Customer Support Bot"), providing creative integration ideas, best-fit tasks, and potential blockers.

Discovery vs. Strict Mode: Allows you to switch between a conservative "Strict Mode" (prioritizing mature, proven tools) and a creative "Discovery Mode" (surfacing novel, experimental gems).

How It Works
The platform operates through a simple but powerful data flow:

Ingest: The EnhancedIngester (ingest.py) runs periodically, fetching new items from configured RSS feeds. It uses AI to write concise descriptions and classifies items as potential tools or news, saving them to data/tools.json and data/news.json.

Score: When you visit the /report page, the Flask app (app.py) loads the tools and runs each one through the EnhancedWorkflowScorer (scorer.py). This is where the multi-stage analysis happens, generating a final score and detailed metrics.

Evaluate: On a workflow-specific page (e.g., /workflow/customer_support_bot), the WorkflowEvaluator (workflow_evaluator.py) performs a deeper, contextual analysis, generating qualitative insights about how a tool could augment or replace parts of that specific workflow.

Present: The Flask application renders the results in a clean, data-rich web interface using HTML templates.
